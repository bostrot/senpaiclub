Steam just announced a new handheld gaming device that looks like it is heavily inspired by the Nintendo Switch. That might not be a bad thing though.

As Steam puts it, this is the "All-in-one portable PC" which "runs the latest AAA games--and runs them really well".

I guess we will see about that but from the specs we see so far I highly doubt it, especially if you get the cheapest version with only 64GB of eMMC storage which could probably not even download most AAA games, especially not CoD Cold War with it's respectable size of well over 100GB.

The Steam Deck will come in three different storage versions: 64GB, 256GB and 512GB with high price jumps in between.

While the cheapest version only has eMMC internal storage it looks like the more expensive versions actually have NVME SSDs installed.

Note:

Despite all that, Steam announced this device would use Linux as its OS. This will probably be a huge deal for Linux Gamers as Steam is already pushing major companies to make their games available and playable on Linux via Steam's inbuild but Open Source Proton tool. &nbsp;Mostly anti-cheat tools, like Easy Anti Cheat, are currently the reason why a lot of games are not working on Linux. This might change in the next couple of months or years because of that.

End Note.
