If you haven't been living under a rock you've probably heard about _Cyberpunk 2077_ these days. A game developed by the same company that blessed us with _The Witcher_ series, _CD Projekt Red_.

In this blog post we're going summarize what we know so far about Cyberpunk 2077. (Status quo 2020-07-07, yes pun intended)

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/assets/img/2020/07/v-logotype-en.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="/assets/img/size/w600/2020/07/v-logotype-en.jpg 600w,/assets/img/size/w1000/2020/07/v-logotype-en.jpg 1000w,/assets/img/size/w1600/2020/07/v-logotype-en.jpg 1600w,/assets/img/2020/07/v-logotype-en.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

First and foremost, the scheduled release date of Cyberpunk for PC and Console is on the **10th of December this year**. This means exactly 157 days from today.  
However people who are looking forward to play it on Google Stadia will have to hold back until the end of 2020 and it gets even worse. Next-Gen consoles players will have to wait until sometime in 2021.

For all the PC players out there, official system requirements haven't been announced yet, but it's safe to assume that you'll need an above average PC to run the game at 1080p and an absolute gaming monster for 4K with 60 frames.  
Furthermore, it has been confirmed that Next-Gen consoles will have a graphically upgraded version up for purchase to take use of the additional power.

**UPDATE SYSTEM REQUIREMENS:**

Now let's take a look at the game itself. _Cyberpunk 2077_ is intended to be a first-person, singleplayer, role-playing experience with a possible multiplayer mode coming with updates later on. You're going to play as _V_ , the highly customisable main character.

There are three classes to choose from:   
NetRunner, who is focused in hacking  
Techie, who is specialized in machinery  
Solo, who is trained in combating

As your character _V_ you are going to enjoy the open world of _Night City_ and its surroundings. This metropolis is built around six regions and the _Badlands_, the outside area of the city.

It is also important to note that the story leads to different endings, which means that you ultimately choose how good of a person you want _V_ to be and more importantly what will happen to _Keanu Reeves_. Yes, motherf\*\*\*ing _Keanu Reeves_ is also a character ingame!!!

Also a small little gimmick, CD Projekt Red decided it would be fun to include some minigames.

_CYBERPUNK: EDGERUNNERS_ ever heard of that?  
Imagine you just finished the game, hanging around at home and don't know what to do. Maybe clean the house, or go grocery shopping or browse furiously through Netflix for some animes, but then suddenly you see the _Cyberpunk_ logo on Netflix and you think...wait what?

You can't believe your eyes, but yes there is definitely a _Cyberpunk_ logo, you click on it and an anime opening starts.

A dream coming true, a 10-episode anime series set in the world of _Cyberpunk 2077_. The series is called _Cyberpunk: Edgerunners_ and is coming 2022 on Netflix, to be more specific a Netflix Original collaboration with _CD Projekt Red_ and the Japanese animation company _Studio Trigger_ (famous for _Kill la Kill_).

Now finally to summarize everything in a short paragraph in the end, _Cyberpunk 2077_ is going to launch on **December 10th, 2020** and it features amazing graphics, a great storyline, unique game mechanics and _Keanu Reeves_. If that's not enough, there will be an anime series in 2022 on Netflix.
